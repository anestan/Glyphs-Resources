## Small Scripts/Hacks
These are small scripts you can run in the macro panel to do various things inside of Glyphs. Most often, they have to do with how Glyphs performs as opposed to editing your actual work.

### Hide Metrics in Text View
When the text tool is selected, the side-bearing values are visible beneath each glyph. By default, these metrics are hidden when the text is viewed at 75pt or smaller. To hide them at larger sizes, run the code below in the Macro panel. In this example, the metrics will be hidden at any size under 151pt.

`Glyphs.intDefaults["TextModeNumbersThreshold"] = 151`

### Save Vector Screenshot of Glyphs Window
This prompts a print dialog box for your Glyphs Window.

`Font.currentTab.graphicView().window().print_(None)`
